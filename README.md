This is the front end application for the music clip scrap book project (aka Piano Tutor app). We used an external API called tone.js - a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser - to create an interactive music experience.

It is a SPA React project with mock backend/external API integration. The following is a link to the [JSON server backend](https://github.com/isogramc/music-sb-json-backend) also hosted here on Github. It is a REST API and our React front end interacts with it using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).

The React application is hosted on [Netlify](https://piano-tutor.netlify.app/profile) and is integrated with our own mock backend hosted on [RENDER](https://music-clip-now.onrender.com). You can also view our [presentation](https://prezi.com/view/mY6IVXCcNhuXQYL3ZXEM/) for the project online.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
